The IDM is introduced in the manuscript and supplementary information.

1. To get the numeric theoretical calculation result, open the "IDM_xxx.nb" file using Wolfram Mathematica and run it. The magnitude of the electromagnetic field components are derived 

2. Copy the results into the "IDM_Radiation_pattern_plot_x.m" for ploting. The "PEC_2.45G_x.csv" file is the simulated radiation pattern using HFSS. Run the matlab "IDM_Radiation_pattern_plot_x.m" to plot the reulsts.

In this section, "bwboundaries" in Image Processing Toolbox is commonly used to find the boundaries of impedance circles on the Smith chart for area calculation, etc.

Please be noted:
The "bwboundaries" function behaves differently on different computers with different screen resolution. This function takes a converted bitmap image as input and the the bitmap conversion differs based on the screen resolution.
All our data are plotted using a 2560x1440 monitor and the same code running on displays with other resolutions is not tested and may lead to unexpected errors.

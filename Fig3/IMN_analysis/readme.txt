1. Open "Inequation_solution_and_plot" and open the "IMN_xxx stub_to MATLAB.nb" file in Wolfram Mathematica and run it to get the solutions for the inequation (14) introduced in the manuscript for both single-stub and double-stub cases.
2. The solutions are saved in different .txt files. Open the "Mathematica-parse_Smithchart_plot_x.m" file in MATLAB to plot the impedance matching capability plot in both Smith chart and Cartesian coordinates.
3. To replicate the IMN process for a given double-stub IMN configuration as illustrated in Fig. 3a, open the "IMN process" folder and open the "Find_load_circle.nb" file in Mathematica to find the solution and save as the .txt file. Then open the "IMN_process_demonstration.m" file to get the five impedance circles on the Smith chart as shown in Fig. 3c.
4. To get the line curves of area percentage as functions of unit segment length and frequency as shown in Fig. 3e,f, open the "Area_calculation" folder and look for certain section and run the codes with the corresponding solutions derived from Mathematica.
